## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>
  
A little about me: I am an undergraduate student, starting off my sophomore year. I learnt the basics of C++ a few months ago. However, when I was off practice, I realized that I had to revisit the content, right from scratch. Consequently, I decided to revisit my notes and books and I typed in mini notes that'll be handy in future too. This is `just bare bones knowledge` about C++ and if you want in depth knowledge, I request you to refer to other sources and books. However, if you're just starting your CS journey, it might be a good idea to cast a glance at these notes as they might help you kickstart your journey.
