# Welcome to the World of Computer Science
* Computer Science is truly growing at an exponential rate where every second, a new software is developed and a new tool is discovered to make everyone's lives simpler.
* Today, a basic understanding of computers is vital in every sphere of life.
* So let's begin this new journey of exploring the world of computers and unravelling many of its mysteries!

## Basics of Computer systems
### 1. Hardware
Any physical part or component of a computer refers to its hardware. It includes:

</br>

**a.** Input devices - Keyboard, mouse, joystick etc.

</br>

**b.** Output devices - Printer, speakers, monitor etc.

</br>

**c.** CPU - The Central Processing Unit
* Its main task is to fetch tasks, perform some operation and produce an output. It can be subdivided into the Control unit and the Arithmetic logic unit.

</br>

**d.** RAM - Random Access Memory (or Main Memory)
* This refers to the memory which is lost once the computer is shut down. 
* It is meant for temporary storage.
* It is also called the `volatile memory` of the computer.
</br>

**e.** Secondary storage 
* This is a type of memory which is retained even when the computer is turned off. 
* It is meant to store information for a longer time.
* It is also called the `non-volatile memory` of the computer.
* Examples - Hard disk drive, State storage device
* In contemporary times, computers use a "hybrid" storage which utilizes both, the hard disk drive and the solid storage device.

</br>

### 2. Software
Any program run on the computer refers to its software. There are two types of softwares:
a.  `Operating system (OS)`
* This software is responsible for interacting with the hardware devices of the computer.

* Windows, Mac OS and Linux are all operating systems

b. `Application software`
* These refer to the programs run on the computer that aid the user to perform the desired tasks.

## Programs and Programming
### Program
* A program is set of instructions that a computer follows while performing a specific task.
### Programming Language
* A programming language is a language used to write computer programs.
Three kinds of programming languages:
1. Machine Level language
* It is directly understood by the processor.
* It is made of binary numbers i.e 0's and 1's

</br>

2. Assembly language
* It is highly specific to some components of the computer hardware.
* It is converted into a machine level language using an assembler.

</br>

3. High level language
* These languages are closer to human language and thus more comprehensible for human beings.
* Examples: C++, Python, R etc

## Steps of interpretation of code written by programmers

1. The programmer writes the code in a high level language which is stored as the **source code**. 
2. A **preprocessor** looks for preprocessor directives in the source code, thus producing a **modified source code**.
3. A **compiler** goes through the **modified source code**, finds syntax errors and then turns it into an **object code**.
4. A **linker** combines the object code with certain pre-defined code (library routines) and produces the **executable code**.
